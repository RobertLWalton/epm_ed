\section{Two Dimensional Geometry Calculator}
This document describes a group of 2-dimensional geometry problems,
starting with simple vector calculations, and working up to polygons and
ellipses.
The problems are embedded in a simple calculator for ease of
testing.

\section{Boolean, Scalars, Vectors, and Transforms}
A \key{boolean} here is either the symbol \key{true} or the symbol \key{false}.

A \key{scalar} here is a double precision floating point number.

A \key{vector} here is a pair $(x,y)$ of double precision floating point
numbers, $x$ denoting an X-coordinate value, and $y$ denoting a
Y-coordinate value.  Such a vector can denote a point $(p_x,p_y)$ in the
XY-plane, or can denote a translation $(v_x,v_y)$ of the plane: \\
\centerline{$(p_x,p_y) \longmapsto (p_x+v_x,p_y+v_y)$}

The product of a scalar $s$ and a vector $v=(v_x,v_y)$ is represented using
$*$ as $s*v = (sv_x,sv_y)$.
The sum of a vector $v=(v_x,v_y)$ and a vector $w=(w_x,w_y)$ is
represented using $+$ as $v+w = (v_x+w_x,v_y+w_y)$.

A \key{linear transformation} here is a pair of vectors, $[\ell_x,\ell_y]$
representing the map:
\centerline{$(v_x,v_y) \longmapsto v_x*\ell_x+v_y*\ell_y$}
Application is represented using
$*$ as $[\ell_x,\ell_y]*v=v_x*\ell_x+v_y*\ell_y$.

A \key{vector list} here is a list of vectors
$(v_1,v_2,\ldots)$.  This can be used to represent the list of vertices
of a polygon or a list of points in the plot of a function.

\section{The Calculator Language}
The calculator language of this problem is very simple.
An example is:
\\[1ex]
{\tt
\hspace*{0.2in}\begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{0.5in}}l}
\rm \bf Input	& \rm \bf Output \\\hline
x=4		& x=4 \\
y = 0.5         & y = 0.5 \\
z = x + y       & z = x + y = 4.5 \\
v=(3,-2)	& v=(3,-2) \\
w=z*v		& w=z*v = (13.5,-9) \\
\# this is a comment & \# this is a comment
\end{tabular}
} % \tt

The syntax is:
\\[1ex]
\hspace*{0.2in}\begin{tabular}{l}
{\em program} ::= {\em statement}$^\star$ \\
{\em statement} ::= \\
\hspace*{0.2in}\begin{tabular}[t]{cl}

		   \end{tabular} \\
{\em function} ::= three or more letters (e.g. {\tt sin} or {\tt length})
\end{tabular}
\\[1ex]
\centerline{
1\begin{tabular}{c}
Whitespace in {\em statements} is optional and is deleted \\
before the {\em statements} are parsed.
\\[1ex]
The output of a {\em statement} is a copy of the {\em statement}, \\

is followed by `{\em space} \TT{=} {\em space} {\em value}'.
\end{tabular}
}

\section{Scalar Calculator}
Implement the calculator with just {\em scalar} and {\em boolean}
value types and the 
{\em operators} and {\em functions}:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l@{~~~~~}l}
Assume:	& {\tt x=}$x$, {\tt y=}$y$ (scalars) \\
	& {\tt d=}$d$ (an integer scalar $0\le d\le 12$) \\
	& {\tt b=}$b$ (a boolean) \\
then: \\[1ex]
\tt x+y & returns $x + y$ \\
\tt x-y & returns $x - y$ \\
\tt x*y & returns $x \times y$ \\
\tt x/y & returns $x / y$ \\
\tt x\%y & returns $x~\mathrm{modulo}~y$ \\
\tt -x & returns $-x$ \\
\tt |x| & returns $|x|$, the absolute value of $x$ \\
\tt cos x & returns $\cos ( (\pi/180) * x )$ [{\tt x} is in degrees] \\
\tt sin x & returns $\sin ( (\pi/180) * x )$ [{\tt x} is in degrees] \\
\tt tan x & returns $\tan ( (\pi/180) * x )$ [{\tt x} is in degrees] \\
\tt x<y:d & returns \TT{true} if $x<y-0.5*10^{-d}$, else \TT{false} \\
\tt x<=y:d & returns \TT{true} if $x<y+0.5*10^{-d}$, else \TT{false} \\
\tt x==y:d & returns \TT{true} if $|x-y|<0.5*10^{-d}$, else \TT{false} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Angles are measured in degrees, with positive angles going counter-clockwise
and negative angles going clockwise.

Comparisons assume the scalars being compared are approximations
to precise numbers that are in units of $10^{-d}$, and therefore to test
for equality the scalars should be (in effect) rounded to the nearest unit.
In addition, the scalars have to be good enough approximations.  As
\label{DOUBLE-SIZE-LIMITS}
double precision floating point numbers are accurate to at most one part
in $10^{16}$, this means that if the units are $10^{-d}$ the scalar
should not have absolute value above $10^{15-d}$.

Division by {\tt 0} will produce results such as
{\tt inf} (plus infinity), {\tt -inf} (minus infinity),
and {\tt nan} (not a number; i.e., result could not be computed).

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
Sample Input File: & \file{00-scalar-vec-2d.sin} \\
Sample Output File: & \file{00-scalar-vec-2d.sout} \\
or: & \file{00-scalar-vec-2d.ftest} \\
Sample Run File: & \file{sample-scalar-vec-2d.run} \\
Submit Run File: & \file{submit-scalar-vec-2d.run} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The {\tt .ftest} files for this problem are identical
to the corresponding {\tt .sout} files.

You can test your program using the indicated sample input and
output and you can submit your program using the indicated submit
run file.  Only scalar functionality is tested.

\section{Coding Hints}
The calculator memory just maps each variable to a value.
You can map each ASCII character to a value using a
vector of 128 elements, and simply not use the elements
that do not correspond to letters.

To parse a non-comment, remove its whitespace characters and
then examine the rightside of the {\tt =} sign.  During this
examination, characters are categorized as either letters,
digits, or operator characters (not letters or digits).
\begin{itemize}
\item If the rightside is a single character, it is a {\em scalar} value
if the character is a digit, a {\em variable} if it is a letter,
and an {\em operator} (with no operands) otherwise.
\item Else if the rightside begins with `{\tt [}' it is {\em linear-transform}
value.
\item Else if the rightside begins with `{\tt ()}' it is an empty
{\em vector-list} value.
\item Else if the rightside begins with `{\tt ((}' it is a non-empty
{\em vector-list} value.
\item Else if the rightside begins with `{\tt (}' and the second character
is not a letter, the rightside is {\em vector} value.
\item Else if one of the first two characters of the rightside is a
digit, the rightside is a {\em scalar} value.
\item Else if the rightside is `{\tt true}' or `{\tt false}', it
is a {\em boolean} value.
\item Else if the rightside begins with two letters, it is a {\em function}
followed optionally by {\em variables}.
\item Else the rightside is an alternating sequence of {\em operators} and
{\em variables}.
\end{itemize}

Data structure and function prototype definitions that you may
optionally use are given in the following files, which may be
downloaded:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\TT{c-defs-vec-2d.txt}	&  for C \\
\TT{cc-defs-vec-2d.txt}	&  for C++ \\
\TT{java-defs-vec-2d.txt}	&  for JAVA \\
\TT{py-defs-vec-2d.txt}	&  for PYTHON \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Using these definitions may make it easier
for other people familiar with this problem to read your
code, should that be important.

We will define the \key{vector sum} of vectors $v=(v_x,v_y)$ and
$w=(w_x,w_y)$ to be $v+w=(v_x+w_x,v_y+w_y)$.  If you
think of a point $p=(p_x,p_y)$ in the XY-plane as a vector,
you can associate a translation $\tau_v$ of the XY-plane
with the vector $v$ using the equation $\tau_v(p)=p+v$.  Then\\
\hspace*{0.2in}$\tau_w(\tau_v(p)) = p+v+w = \tau_{v+w}(p)$ \\
See the picture.
\\[1ex]
Vector sums are commutative, i.e.,  $v+w=w+v$, and associative,
i.e., $u+(v+w)=(u+v)+w$.

We define the \key{scalar product} of a scalar $s$ and a vector
$v=(v_x,v_y)$ as $s*v = (s*v_x,s*v,y)$.  Multiplication
of $v$ by $s>0$ does not change the direction of $v$,
but multiplies the length of $v$ by $s$.  Multiplication of $v$ by
$s<0$ reverses the direction of $v$ and multiplies its length
by $|s|$.  See the picture.
\\[1ex]
Scalar products are associative in the sense that
$s_1*(s_2*v)=(s_1*s_2)*v$.

\end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{wrapfigure}
A vector $v=(v_x,v_y)$ has a length and a direction.
The \key{length}, denoted by $||v||$, can be computed using
Pythagoras's Theorem: $||v||=\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2}$.  The
direction is given by the counterclockwise angle $\theta$ from
the positive X-axis direction to the vector direction.
This is called the \key{azimuth} of $v$, and in computer
languages may be computed (in radians) by the {\tt atan2} function as
$\theta = \mathrm{atan2}(v_y,v_x)$ (note $v_y$ comes before $v_x$).
\end{minipage}

We measure angles, including azimuths, in degrees.  To convert degrees
to radians, multiply by $\pi/180$, and to convert radians to degrees,
multiply by $180/\pi$.  Positive angles are counter-clockwise, and
negative angles are clockwise.

For a vector {\tt v},~~{\tt asm v} and {\tt ||v||} are said to be
the \key{polar coordinates} of {\tt v}.
The vector with the polar coordinates $\theta$ (azimuth) and $\ell$ (length) is
$(\ell \cos\theta,\ell \sin\theta)$.
See the picture.

Adding integer multiples of 360 to a vector's
azimuth does \underline{not} change the vector.

\section{Vector Calculator}
Implement additions to the basic calculator for just {\em vector}
value types and the {\em operators} and {\em functions}:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l@{~~~~~}l@{~~~~~}l}
Assume: & {\tt s=}$s$, {\tt x=}$x$, {\tt y=$y$},
          {\tt l=$\ell$}, {\tt t=$\theta$}
          are scalars \\
	& {\tt d=}$d$ (an integer scalar $0\le d\le 12$) \\
	& {\tt v=}$(v_x,v_y)$, {\tt w=}$(w_x,w_y)$ are vectors \\
then: \\[1ex]
\tt (x,y) & returns $(x,y)$ \\
\tt v==w:d & returns $v_x==w_x:d$ AND $v_y==w_y:d$ \\
\tt s*v & returns $(s v_x, s v_y )$ \\
\tt -v & returns $( -v_x, -v_y )$, {\tt v} with direction reversed \\
\tt v+w & returns $(v_x + w_x, v_y + w_y)$ \\
\tt v-w & returns $(v_x - w_x, v_y - w_y)$ \\
\tt ||v|| & returns $\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}$ & [length] \\
\tt azm v & returns $\mathrm{atan2}(v_y,v_x)*(180/\pi)$ & [azimuth] \\
\tt l\textasciicircum t
          & returns $(\ell\cos\theta,\ell\sin\theta)$, \\
	  & the vector with length {\tt l} and azimuth {\tt t} degrees \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

If {\tt ||v|| = 0} then {\tt azm~v} is undefined (you can do extra
programming to make it defined as {\tt nan} if you like, but this
is not necessary).

\end{center}

The {\tt .ftest} files for this problem are identical
to the corresponding {\tt .sout} files.

You can test your program using the indicated sample input and
output and you can submit your program using the indicated submit

\newpage

\section{Display Language}
Points, lines, arrows, etc.~can be displayed in a PDF file
by making a {\tt .pdf} file from an {\tt .in} or {\tt .fout}
file.  The display commands are embedded in `{\tt \#}' comment
lines, so your program does not have to deal with them.

The display commands are:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l@{~~~~~}l@{~~~~~}l}
\tt \#!point p [color] & draws point {\tt p} labelling it `{\tt p}' \\
\tt \#!line pq [color] & draws line from point {\tt p} to point {\tt q} \\
\tt \#!arrow pq [color] & draws arrow from point {\tt p} to point {\tt q} \\
\tt \#!infline pq [color] & draws infinite line through points \\
                          & {\tt p} and {\tt q} \\
\tt \#!infarrow pq [color] & draws infinite directed line through \\
                           & points {\tt p} and {\tt q}
			     with arrow from {\tt p} to {\tt q} \\
\tt \#!circle cr [color] & draws circle of radius {\tt r} and center {\tt c} \\
\tt \#!line L  [color] & draws lines with endpoints that are \\
                       & consecutive points in the list of points {\tt L} \\
\tt \#!polygon L  [color] & draws the polygon whose vertices are \\
                       & the points in the list of points {\tt L} \\
\tt \#!label text... & `{\tt text...}' is used as a page label \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

In the above {\tt p}, {\tt q}, {\tt c} are arbitrary {\em variables} whose
values must be vectors denoting points, and {\tt r} is an arbitrary
{\em variable} whose value must be a strictly positive scalar.
The variable name is used
to label the points generated by the `{\tt \#!point}' command, but
the lines, arrows, and circles  are not labelled.

The output from on test case
is a single page labelled with the test case name (e.g., {\tt 00-000-vec-2d}).
Each `{\tt \#!label}' command adds a one-line label.

The possible
optional colors
are `{\tt red}', `{\tt blue}', `{\tt brown}', and `{\tt black}', which is
the default.
(green does not show up when the page is printed in black-and-white, and
so is not provided).

\section{Linear Transforms}
If we let $\mathcal{R}$ denote the set of real numbers,
a.k.a., scalars, the set of all vectors is \\
\centerline{
$\mathcal{R}\times\mathcal{R}=\mathcal{R}^2
    =\{(v_x,v_y)|v_x,v_y\in \mathcal{R}\}$}

\begin{definition}\label{LINEAR-TRANSFORMATION}
A \key{linear transformation} $L$ is a continuous map
$L:\mathcal{R}^2\mapsto\mathcal{R}^2$ such that for
all vectors $v$ and $w$, $L(v+w)=L(v)+L(w)$.
\end{definition}

Some examples of linear transformations are (1) the identity map,
(2) rotations, (3) reflections about an axis, (4) scale changes
(i.e., $(v_x,v_y)\longmapsto(s_x v_x,s_y v_y)$ for scalars $s_x$
and $s_y$).

(In vector algebra, linear transformations with domains and/or ranges
that are vector spaces other than $\mathcal{R}^2$ are studied.)


\begin{lemma}
Let $L$ be a linear transformation, $v$ and $w$ be vectors,
and $0=(0,0)$ be the zero vector.  Then $L(0)=0$,  $L(-v)=-L(v)$,
and $L(v-w) = L(v) - L(w)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{indpar}{0.5in}
Proof: $L(0) = L(0+0)= L(0) + L(0)$ so subtracting $L(0)$
from both sides, $0=L(0)$.  $0 = L(0) = L(v-v) = L(v) + L(-v)$
so subtracting $L(v)$ from both sides $-L(v)=L(-v)$.
$L(v-w)=L(v+(-w))=L(v)+L(-w)=L(v)+(-L(w))=L(v)-L(w)$.
\end{indpar}

\begin{lemma}
Let $L$ be a linear transformation, $s$ be a scalar, and $v$ be a vector.
Then $L(s*v)=s*L(v)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{indpar}{0.5in}
Proof: The cases $s=0,1,2,-1,-2$ follow from the previous lemma and
using induction proves the lemma for any integer $s$.  For $s=n/d$
a rational number with integers $n$ and $d$ and $d>0$, \\
\hspace*{0.1in}$n*L(v) = L(n*(d/d)*v) = L(d*(n/d)*v)=d*L((n/d)*v)$ \\
so dividing by $d$
we get $L((n/d)*v)=(n/d)*L(v)$.  For $s$ a non-rational real number,
the result follows from a continuity argument that we will leave
to the mathematicians, since computer scientists only compute
with rational numbers.
\end{indpar}

Let $L$ be a linear transformation; let $v=(v_x,v_y)$ be a vector;
let $u_x=(1,0)$ and $u_y =(0,1)$.  Then \\
\centerline{$L(v) = L(v_x*u_x+v_y*u_y)=v_x*L(u_x)+v_y*L(u_y)$.}

\begin{lemma}
Given vectors $\ell_x$ and $\ell_y$, the map
$L:(v_x,v_y)\longmapsto v_x*\ell_x+v_y*\ell_y$ is a linear
transformation.
\end{lemma}
\begin{indpar}{0.5in}
Proof: $L(v+w) = (v_x+w_x)*\ell_x+(v_y+w_y)*\ell_y
               = v_x*\ell_x+v_y*\ell_y+w_x*\ell_x+w_y*\ell_y
	       = L(v) + L(w)$.
\end{indpar}

So $L$ is determined by $\ell_x = L(u_x)$ and $\ell_y = L(u_y)$,
and there is a 1-1 correspondence between linear transformations
and vector pairs $(\ell_x,\ell_y)$.  Therefore we will represent a linear
transformation $L$ by a pair of vectors {\tt ($\ell_x$,$\ell_y$)}
and represent application of L to the vector {\tt v = ($v_x$,$v_y$)} by \\
\centerline{\tt $L(v)$ = ($\ell_x$,$\ell_y$)*($v_x$,$v_y$) =
             $v_x$*$\ell_x$+$v_y$*$\ell_y$}

Examples:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt L=[(1,0),(0,1)]} is the identity map.
$L(v)=v_x*(1,0) + v_y*(0,1) = (v_x,0)+(0,v_y) = (v_x,v_y) = v$.
\item {\tt L=[(0,1),(-1,0)]} rotates vectors $90^\circ$.
Specifically, $L(u_x)=u_y$ and $L(u_y)=-u_x$ and
$L(v)=v_x*(0,1) + v_y*(-1,0) = (0,v_x)+(-v_y,0) = (-v_y,v_x)$.
\item {\tt L=[(-1,0),(0,-1)]} reverses the direction of a vector.
$L(v)=v_x*(-1,0) + v_y*(0,-1) = (-v_x,0)+(0,-v_y) = (-v_x,-v_y) = -v$.
\item {\tt L=[(-1,0),(0,1)]} reflects vectors across the Y-axis.
$L(v)=v_x*(-1,0) + v_y*(0,1) = (-v_x,0)+(0,v_y) = (-v_x,v_y)$.
\item {\tt L=[($s_x$,0),(0,$s_y$)]} scales the X-axis by $s_x$ and
the Y-axis by $s_y$. \\
$L(v)=v_x*(s_x,0) + v_y*(0,s_y)
     = (s_x v_x,0)+(0,s_y v_y)= (s_x v_x, s_y v_y)$.
\end{enumerate}

Now suppose we have a scalar {\tt s}, vector {\tt v},
and two linear transformations
{\tt K = [$\ell^K_x$,$\ell^K_y$)},
{\tt L = [$\ell^L_x$,$\ell^L_y$)}.  Then we can define:
\begin{center}
\tt
\begin{tabular}{l@{~so that~}l}
s*L = [s*$\ell^L_x$,s*$\ell^L_y$]
	 & (s*L)*v = s*(L*v) \\[0.3ex]
K+L = [$\ell^K_x$+$\ell^L_x$,$\ell^K_y$+$\ell^L_y$]
	 & (K+L)*v = K*v + L*v \\[0.3ex]
K+L = [$\ell^K_x$+$\ell^L_x$,$\ell^K_y$+$\ell^L_y$]
	 & (K+L)*v = K*v + L*v \\[0.3ex]
K-L = [$\ell^K_x$-$\ell^L_x$,$\ell^K_y$-$\ell^L_y$]
	 & (K-L)*v = K*v - L*v \\[0.3ex]
-L = [-$\ell^L_x$,-$\ell^L_y$]
	 & (-L)*v = - L*v \\[0.3ex]
K*L = [K*$\ell^L_x$,K*$\ell^L_y$]
	 & (K*L)*v = K*(L*v)
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

{\tt *} and {\tt +} as defined here are bi-linear
(letting {\tt J} be another linear transformation):
\begin{center}
\tt
s*(K+L) = s*K + s*L \\
(J+K)*L = J*L + K*L \\
J*(K+L) = J*K + J*L
\end{center}

In general {\tt K*L} is \underline{not equal} to {\tt L*K}.

Let {\tt I} be the identity transform defined by
{\tt I*v=v} for all vectors {\tt v}  (and therefore {\tt I=[$u_x$,$u_y$]}).
It is easy to check that {\tt K*I = K = I*K} for all linear transforms
{\tt K}.

A linear transform {\tt K} is defined to be the (two-sided) \key{inverse}
of the linear transform {\tt L} if and only if {\tt K*L = I = L*K}.
The inverse of {\tt L} might not exist, but if it does, it is unique
since if there were two, {\tt K$_1$} and {\tt K$_2$}, then \\
\centerline{\tt K$_1$ = K$_1$*I = K$_1$*(L*K$_2$)
                      = (K$_1$*L)*K$_2$ = I*K$_2$ = K$_2$}
The notation {\tt L$^{-1}$} is used for the inverse of {\tt L} if it
exists.  For example, the inverse of a rotation by angle $\phi$ in the
counter-clockwise direction is a rotation by angle $\phi$ in the
clockwise direction.

(One-sided inverses that are not two-sided inverses only exist for
linear transformations whose domain and range are vector spaces of
\underline{different} dimensions, unlike our linear transformations
whose domain and range are both 2-dimensional.)

\section{Rotations and Reflections}
Rotations and reflections are the two kinds of linear transformations
that preserve vector lengths (i.e., $||L(v)||=||v||$).

A reflection perserves side-lengths and negates angles of a triangle.

\end{minipage}

\vspace{0.5in}

A linear map $L$ that preserves vector lengths ($||L(v)||=||v||$)
is said to be \key{unitary}.
A unitary linear map $L$
also preserves the absolute values of angles between vectors,
because $L$ preserves the side-lengths of any triangle made of
vectors, and these determine the absolute values of the angles of
the triangle (but not the direction of these angles).  Now
$L$ being linear is determined by $L(u_x)$ and $L(u_y)$, where
$u_x=(1,0)$ and $u_y=(0,1)$, and as $u_y$ is perpendicular to
$u_x$, $L(u_y)$ must be perpendicular to $L(u_x)$ if $L$ is unitary.
So for unitary $L$, in 2 dimensions there are only two possibilities
for $L(u_y)$ given $L(u_x)$.


$u_y$ is $u_x$ rotated counter-clockwise by 90 degrees.
If for unitary $L$, $L(u_y)$ is $L(u_x)$ rotated counter-clockwise
by 90 degrees, $L$ is a rotation.
But if $L(u_y)$ is $L(u_x)$ rotated clockwise
by 90 degrees, $L$ is a reflection.  All unitary linear transformations
in 2 dimensions must be either rotations or reflections.

If $L$ is a rotation, the angle of rotation is: \\
\centerline{$\phi = \mathrm{asm}~L(u_x) - \mathrm{asm}~u_x =
             \mathrm{asm}~L(u_x)$}
and we have: \begin{tabular}[t]{l}
             $L(u_x)=(\cos\phi,\sin\phi)$ \\
             $L(u_y)=(-\sin\phi,\cos\phi)$ \\
	     \end{tabular}

If $L$ is a reflection, the angle of the reflecting line is: \\
\centerline{$\phi = (1/2)*(\mathrm{asm}~L(u_x) + \mathrm{asm}~u_x)
                  = (1/2)*(\mathrm{asm}~L(u_x))$}
and we have: \begin{tabular}[t]{l}
             $L(u_x)=(\cos(2*\phi),\sin(2*\phi))$ \\
             $L(u_y)=(\sin(2*\phi),-\cos(2*\phi))$ \\
	     \end{tabular}

Both rotations and reflections preserve vector lengths
and change vector angles according to a linear formula.
Using the notation $R^\phi$ for rotation by angle $\phi$,
and $F^\phi$ for reflection about the line at angle $\phi$,
we get the following:
\begin{center}
$R^\phi*R^\omega=R^\omega*R^\phi=R^{\phi+\omega}$
~~because~~
    $(\mathrm{azm}~v + \omega) + \phi = \mathrm{azm}~v + (\phi+\omega)$ \\
$F^\phi*F^\omega = R^{2(\phi-\omega)}$
~~because~~
    $2\phi - (2\omega - \mathrm{azm}~v) = \mathrm{azm}~v + 2(\phi-\omega)$ \\
$R^\phi*F^\omega = F^\omega*R^{-\phi}$
~~because~~
    $(2\omega - \mathrm{azm}~v) + \phi =
      2\omega - (\mathrm{azm}~v + (-\phi))$
\end{center}
Note that:
\begin{center}
$R^\phi*R^\omega=R^{\omega+\phi}=R^\omega*R^\phi$ \\
$R^\phi$ and $R^\omega$ commute \\
$R^{-\phi}$ is the inverse of $R^\phi$ \\
$F^\phi*F^\phi= I$ (the identity) so  $F^\phi$ is its own inverse \\
$F^\omega*F^\phi$ is the inverse of $F^\phi*F^\omega$ \\
in general $F^\phi$ and $F^\omega$ do \underline{not} commute\\

\section{Products}
There are two products of a pair of vectors that play a
very important role in 2D computational geometry:

\begin{definition}
The \key{scalar product} of two vectors \\
\centerline{{\tt v = ($v_x$,$v_y$)} and {\tt w = ($w_x$,$w_y$)}} \\
is \\
\centerline{\tt v*w = $v_x w_x + v_y w_y$} \\
The \key{cross product} of the two vectors is \\
\centerline{\tt v\#w = $(-v_y)w_x + v_x w_y$}
\end{definition}

Note that {\tt ||v||$^2$ = v*v}.

If we denote the rotation counter-clockwise by 90 degrees by {\tt R}$^{90}$,
then \\
\centerline{\tt v\#w = (-$v_y$,$v_x$)*w = R$^{90}$(v)*w}

Both the scalar and cross product are \key{bi-linear}.  That is,
if {\tt u}, {\tt v}, {\tt w} are vectors and {\tt s} is a scalar:
\begin{center}
\tt
(u+v)*w = u*w + v*w \\
u*(v+w) = u*v + u*w \\
(s*u)*w = s*(u*w) = u*(s*w) \\
(u+v)\#w = u\#w + v\#w \\
u\#(v+w) = u\#v + u\#w \\
(s*u)\#w = s*(u\#w) = u\#(s*w)
\end{center}

The scalar product is symmetric ({\tt v*w = w*v})
while the cross product is anti-symmetric ({\tt v\#w = -w\#v}).

\begin{lemma}
For a unitary transform {\tt L}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt L(v)*L(w) = v*w} for all vectors {\tt v} and {\tt w}.
\item If {\tt L} is a rotation,
         {\tt L(v)\#L(w) = v\#w} for all vectors {\tt v} and {\tt w}; \\
      if {\tt L} is a reflection,
         {\tt L(v)\#L(w) = - v\#w} for all vectors {\tt v} and {\tt w}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{indpar}{0.3in}
Proof: Since {\tt L} is unitary: \\
{\small \tt
\hspace*{0.05in}
       \begin{tabular}[t]{rcl}

We can use the fact that $*$ and $\#$ are invariant under
rotations to give a geometric characterization
of these two products.  Let $v$ and $w$ be two vectors, let
$\theta=\mathrm{asm}~w - \mathrm{asm}~v$ be the direction angle of $w$
relative to $v$, and let $\phi = \mathrm{asm}~v$ be the aszimuth of $v$
(see the picture).
If we rotate both vectors by $R^{-\phi}$
we line $v$ up with the positive X-axis, while not changing $\theta$,
$||v||$, $||w||$, $v*w$, or $v\#w$.  So after rotation we have
\hspace*{0.5in}
    \begin{tabular}{l@{~~~~~}l}
    $v=(||v||,0)$ &
    $w=(||w||\cos\theta,||w||\sin\theta)$ \\
    $v*w=||v||\times||w||\times\cos\theta$ & 
    $v\#w=||v||\times||w||\times\sin\theta$ \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{minipage}

From this we deduce two things.  First, \\
\hspace*{0.5in}
    \begin{tabular}{l@{~~~~~}l}
    $v*w=||v||\times||w||\times\cos\theta$ &
    $v\#w=||v||\times||w||\times\sin\theta$ \\
    \end{tabular} \\
before rotation, as well as after rotation,
which gives a geometric characterization of the products.

Second,\hspace{0.5in}$||v||*R^{-\mathrm{azm}~v}*w=(v*w,v\#w)$,
\\[1ex]
which gives us a quick way to change coordinate systems
by a rotation times scalar multiplication by $||v||$ so that
$v$ has coordinates $(||v||^2,0)$ in the new coordinate system.
Problems that might be hard to solve in the original
coordinate system can be easly to solve in the new coordinate
system.  For example, the end of $w$ is to the left of the infinite directed
line extending $v$ if and only if $v\#w>0$.

Note that a distance in
the new coordinate system is $||v||$ times the corresponding
distance in the old coordinate system.  If absolute distances are
of importance, it may be best to choose $v$ so that $||v||=1$.

    & $-~(1/2)*(p_2-p_1)\#(p_3-p_1)$ \\
    \end{tabular} \\
~\\
So we can use the cross product to compute triangle areas,
but its a bit tricky because what we get is a signed area.
The result is positive if
the angle $\theta$ measured from the first factor of $\#$ to the
second factor of $\#$ is in the range $[0,180]$, and negative if
$\theta$ is in the range $[-180,0]$.

\section{Line and Point}\label{LINE-AND-POINT}
In this section we investigate the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Is a point on, to the left of, or to the right of
an infinite directed line?  What is the distance from the
point to the line and where is the closest point that is
on the line?
\item What is the general position of a point relative
to a finite line segment?  What is the distance from the
point to the line segment?
\end{enumerate}

We begin with a line {\tt pq} from point {\tt p} to point {\tt q},
{\tt p$\neq$q}.
We may take this line to be either infinite, or to be a finite
line seqment with ends {\tt p} and {\tt q}.  We may take the
line to be undirected, or to be directed from {\tt p} to {\tt q}.

We then consider a third point {\tt r} and ask about its relation
to {\tt pq}.

The answers to most of our questions will not be changed if we perform
a coordinate translation on all the points, so we begin by moving
{\tt p} to the origin {\tt (0,0)} using a translation by {\tt -p}.
Our points become:
\begin{center} \tt
p - p = (0,0) \\
q - p \\
r - p
\end{center}
Next we apply either the pure rotation $R^{\tt -azm(q-p)}$
or this rotation followed by multiplication by {\tt ||q-p||}.  We use
the first if we want to preserve and measure distances, and the
second if we want precise answers to questions like: is {\tt r} on the
line {\tt pq}?

If we apply the pure rotation $R^{\tt -azm(q-p)}$ after the translation
{\tt -p}, we get:
\begin{center} \tt
P = (0,0) \\
Q = ( ||q - p||, 0 ) \\
R = ( (q-p)!*(r-p), (q-p)!\#(r-p) ) = (X,Y)
\end{center}
where we have defined {\tt X} and {\tt Y} to be the coordinates of {\tt R}

If\label{DISTANCE-OF-LINE-TO-POINT}
we want the distance from {\tt r} to the infinite line {\tt pq},
then this is the same as the distance from {\tt R = (X,Y)} to the infinite
line {\tt PQ}, and the latter is the X-axis.  So the answer is \\
\centerline{\tt |Y| = |(q-p)!\#(r-p)| = (1/||q-p||)*|(q-p)\#(r-p)|}

Next we want to find the point {\tt t} on the infinite line {\tt pq}
that is closest to {\tt r}.
The point on the X-axis {\tt PQ} that is closest to {\tt R = (X,Y)}
is {\tt T=(X,0)} and
we know that: \\
\hspace*{0.3in}\begin{tabular}{rl}
       & {\tt T = $R^{\tt -azm(q-p)}$*(t-p)} \\
   and & {\tt T = (X/||q-p||)*Q} \\
   and & {\tt $R^{\tt -azm(q-p)}$*(q-p) = Q} \\
    so & {\tt $R^{\tt -azm(q-p)}$*(t-p) = (X/||q-p||)*Q} \\
    so & {\tt $R^{\tt -azm(q-p)}$*(t-p) =
        (X/||q-p||)*$R^{\tt -azm(q-p)}$*(q-p)} \\
    so & {\tt $R^{\tt -azm(q-p)}$*(t-p) =
        $R^{\tt -azm(q-p)}$*(X/||q-p||)*(q-p)} \\
    so & {\tt t-p = (X/||q-p||)*(q-p) = X*(q-p)!} \\ 
   and & {\tt t = p + X*(q-p)!~= p + ((q-p!)*(r-p))*(q-p)!} \\
   or & {\tt t = p + (1/(q-p)*(q-p)) * ((q-p)*(r-p))*(q-p)} \\
       \end{tabular}

Note that {\tt t} has rational\label{CLOSEST-IS-RATIONAL},
and \underline{not} irrational,
coordinates.  However the denominator may be very large.  If
the input coordinates have at most {\tt d} decimal places,
their denominator is at most $10^d$, and the denominator of {\tt t}
may be as large as \\
\centerline{\tt 10$^{\tt 3d}$*(numerator of (q-p)*(q-p))}

    \draw[black] (+8.0,+3.0) node{\small \tt R=(X,Y)};

\end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{wrapfigure}
If we want the distance from {\tt r} to the \underline{finite} line {\tt pq},
then this is the same as the distance from {\tt R} to the finite
line {\tt PQ}, and there are three cases.  If {\tt X<0}, the answer
is {\tt ||R-P||=||r-p||}.  If {\tt X>||q-p||},
the answer is {\tt ||R-Q||=||r-q||}.
Otherwise the answer is {\tt |Y|} as before.  See picture.
\end{minipage}

Now suppose we want a precise answer to the question: is {\tt r}
on the line {\tt pq}?  The trouble with 
$R^{\tt -azm(q-p)}$ is that its parameters are not precise rational
numbers, or even approximations to precise rational numbers.
We can remedy this by switching to the linear transformation
{\tt ||q-p||*$R^{\tt -azm(q-p)}$}.  Then we get:
\begin{center} \tt
P = (0,0) \\
Q = ( (q-p)*(q-p), 0 ) \\
R = ( (q-p)*(r-p), (q-p)\#(r-p) ) = (X,Y)
\end{center}
If the coordinates of {\tt p}, {\tt q}, and {\tt r} have at
most {\tt d} decimal places, they are rational numbers with
denominator {\tt 10$^{\tt d}$}, and the products will be rational
numbers with denominator {\tt 10$^{\tt 2d}$}.  Or more precisely,
the products will be close approximations to such rational numbers.
Therefore:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt r} is to the left of the infinite directed line {\tt pq}
if and only if {\tt 0<Y:(2d)}.
\item {\tt r} is to the right of the infinite directed line {\tt pq}
if and only if {\tt Y<0:(2d)}.
\item {\tt r} is on the infinite directed line {\tt pq}
if and only if {\tt Y==0:(2d)}.
\item {\tt r} is on the finite line {\tt pq} if and only if \\
\hspace*{0.3in}\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l}
               {\tt Y==0:(2d)},~~~{\tt 0<=X:(2d)},~~~and
	           {\tt X<=(p-q)*(p-q):(2d)} \\
	       where {\tt X = (q-p)*(r-p) ~~~ Y = (q-p)\#(r-p)} \\
	       \end{tabular}

\section{Line and Line}
In this section we investigate the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Do two infinite lines intersect, and if so where?
\item Do two finite lines intersect, and if so where?
\item What is the distance between two finite lines?
\end{enumerate}

Let {\tt q} and {\tt r} be distinct points so that the set
of points on the infinite line {\tt qr} is: \\
\centerline{{\tt K} = \{ {\tt q + s*(r-q)}: {\tt s} any scalar \}} 

Let {\tt m} and {\tt n} be more distinct points so that the set
of points on the infinite line {\tt mn} is: \\
\centerline{{\tt K} = \{ {\tt m + t*(n-m)}: {\tt t} any scalar \}} 

If these two infinite lines intersect, there must exist values for
{\tt s} and {\tt t} such that: \\
\centerline{{\tt q + s*(r-q) = m + t*(n-m)}}

The easy way to solve this is to take the cross product of both
sides with {\tt n-m}, because
{\tt (n-m)\#(t*(n-m)) = t*((n-m)\#(n-m)) = t*0 = 0}.
So we end up with: \\
\centerline{\tt s*(n-m)\#(r-q) = (n-m)\#(m-q)} \\
which we can solve for {\tt s}.  Unless {\tt (n-m)\#(r-q) = 0}.

What happens if {\tt (n-m)\#(r-q) = 0}? \\
\hspace*{0.3in}\begin{tabular}{r@{~~}l}
Then    & \tt (n-m)\#(r-q) = sin $\theta$*||n-m||*||r-q|| = 0 \\
where   & \tt ||n-m|| $\neq$ 0 $\neq$ ||r-q|| \\
and     & \tt $\theta$ = asm (r-q) - asm (n-m) \\
so      & \tt sin $\theta$ = 0 \\
so      & \tt $\theta$ = 0 or $\pm$180 \\
so      & {\tt nm} and {\tt rq} are parallel \\
        \end{tabular}

The converse is also true.  If {\tt mn} and {\tt rq} are parallel, \\
\hspace*{0.3in}\begin{tabular}{r@{~~}l}
then    & {\tt ||n-m|| = s*||r-q||} for some scalar {\tt s} \\
so      & \tt (n-m)\#(r-q) = s*((r-q)\#(r-q)) = 0 \\
        \end{tabular}

Of course, testing a product to see if it is {\tt 0} is subject to
rounding errors.  So we assume that the coordinates of {\tt m},
{\tt n}, {\tt q}, and {\tt r} have at most {\tt d} decimal places,
and therefore {\tt mn} is parallel to {\tt qr} if and only if
{\tt (n-m)\#(r-q)==0:(2d)}.

The question of whether two finite lines intersect is made
simpler by the following:
\begin{lemma}
Two \underline{non-parallel} finite lines intersect
if and only if each intersects the infinite extension of the other.
\end{lemma}
\begin{indpar}{0.3in}
Proof: Let the finite lines be $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ and let
$\ell_i$ intersect the infinite extension of the other finite line
at point $p_i$.  Then $p_1=p_2=$ the intersection of the infinite
extensions of both lines, and as $p_i$ is on $\ell_i$, this point is
on both finite lines.

The converse is trivial.
\end{indpar}

If we have a finite line {\tt mn} and and infinite line extending
{\tt qr}, then they intersect if and only if either {\tt m} or {\tt n}
is on the infinite line or {\tt m} and {\tt n} are on opposite sides
of the infinite line.  Then we know from the end of
section~\ref{LINE-AND-POINT} (p\pageref{LINE-AND-POINT}) that
if coordinates have at most {\tt d} decimal places, then
there is an intersection if and only if:\\
\centerline{{\tt (r-q)\#(m-q)<=0:(2d)} and {\tt 0<=(r-q)\#(n-q):(2d)}} \\
\centerline{or} \\
\centerline{{\tt (r-q)\#(n-q)<=0:(2d)} and {\tt 0<=(r-q)\#(m-q):(2d)}}

(This could also be written as: \\
\centerline{{\tt ((r-q)\#(m-q))*((r-q)\#(n-q))<=0:(4d)}} \\
but the change from {\tt 2d} to {\tt 4d} is worrisome: {\tt 4d} might
be too large to be practical.)

The case where {\tt mn} and {\tt qr} are parallel, that is, when: \\
\centerline{{\tt (r-q)\#(n-m)==0:(2d)}} \\
requires a different approach.  If {\tt n} is not on the infinite
line that extends {\tt rq}, that is if: \\
\centerline{{\tt 0!=(r-q)\#(n-q):(2d)}} \\
then there is no intersection.  Otherwise both {\tt nm} and {\tt qr}
are on the same infinite line and may or may not overlap.
We can use the {\tt (r-q)*} product to establish coordinates on this
infinite line, getting: \\
\centerline{\tt (r-q)*m ~~~ (r-q)*n ~~~ (r-q)*q ~~~ (r-q)*r} \\
Then by exchanging {\tt m} with {\tt n} and {\tt q} with {\tt r}
\underline{if necessary} we can arrange that: \\
\centerline{\tt (r-q)*m<(r-q)*n:(2d) ~ and ~ (r-q)*q<(r-q)*r:(2d)} \\
and there will be an overlap if and only if it is \underline{not}
true that \\
\centerline{\tt (r-q)*n<(r-q)*q:(2d) ~ or ~ (r-q)*r<(r-q)*m:(2d)} \\
If there is an overlap, the overlap interval will be: \\
\centerline{\tt [ max\{(r-q)*m,(r-q)*q\}, min\{(r-q)*n,(r-q)*r\} ]} \\
expressed in {\tt (r-q)*} coordinates.  Since the points on our
line have the form {\tt q + s*(r-q)}, a point on the line with
{\tt (r-q)*} coordinate {\tt S} would be such that \\
\centerline{\tt (r-q)*q + s*(r-q)*(r-q) = S} \\
and this can be solved for {\tt s}.

\section{Circle, Line, and Point}
In this section we investigate the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the distance between a point and a circle (viewed as
a curving line and \underline{not} an area)?
Is the point on the circle?
\item Where do the lines tangent to a circle that pass through
an external point contact the
circle?
\item Does an infinite line intersect a circle?  Is it
tangent to the circle?  Where does it intersect?
\item What is the distance between a finite line segment and
a circle?  If zero, where are the intersections?  If not zero,
where is the point on the finite line segment that is closest to the
circle.
\end{enumerate}

Suppose we have a point {\tt p} and a circle with center {\tt c}
and radius {\tt r>0}.  Then the distance from {\tt p} to the circle
is the absolute value of {\tt ||p-c|| - r},
where we view the circle as a closed line
and \underline{not} as an area.

To precisely test whether {\tt p} is outside, on, or inside the
circle, assuming that input coordinates and {\tt r} have at most
{\tt d} decimal places, we can use the equations:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l@{~~~~~}l}
\tt r$^2$ < (p-c)*(p-c):(2d) & outside the circle \\
\tt (p-c)*(p-c) == r$^2$:(2d) & on the circle \\
\tt (p-c)*(p-c) < r$^2$:(2d) & inside the circle \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}\raggedright
\label{TANGENT-PICTURE}
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.3\textwidth}

    \draw[brown] (0,0) -- (2.598076,1.5);


\end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{wrapfigure}
Now suppose that {\tt p} is outside the circle and we want to find
a point {\tt t} on the circle such that {\tt pt} is tangent to the
circle.  See the picture. \\
~ \\
\label{FINDING-TANGENT-POINT}
We define {\tt b} to be the point on {\tt pc} such that
{\tt tbp} is a right angle.  Then we have: \\
\hspace*{0.2in}\begin{tabular}{@{}l} \\
    {\tt ptc} is a right angle \\
    {\tt ||p-c||} is known \\
    {\tt ||t-c||=r} \\
    triangles {\tt ptc} and {\tt tbc} are congruent \\
    so {\tt \small ||b-c||/||t-c|| = ||t-c||/||p-c||} \\
    so {\tt \small ||b-c|| = r$^2$/||p-c||} \\
    and using \\
    {\tt ||b-t|| = $\sqrt{{\tt r}^2 - {\tt ||b-c||}^2}$} \\
    we can compute both {\tt ||b-c||} and {\tt ||b-t||}; \\
    then if we define {\tt u = (p-c)!} we have \\
    {\tt b = c + ||b-c||*u} \\
    {\tt t = b $\pm$ ||b-q||*(u\textasciicircum 90)} \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{minipage}

The reason for the $\pm$ is that we actually have two possible
values for {\tt t}, one on either side of the line {\tt pc}.

It turns out that the coordinates of {\tt b} are rational
with denominator containing {\tt (p-c)*(p-c)}.  However, the
coordinates of {\tt t} are irrational in general, due to
$\sqrt{\tt (p-c)*(p-c) - 1}$ being a factor while other factors are rational.
It comes down the the question of whether if {\tt p-c = 10$^{-d}$*(x,y)}
for integers {\tt x} and {\tt y}, then is
{\tt x$^2$+y$^2$-(10$^d$)$^2$} a perfect square.
For example, $101^2+201^2-100^2= 40602$ contains the factor $2$ only once
and is therefore not a perfect square.
Most of the time the sum will \underline{not}
be a perfect square, and so most of the time at least one of the
coordinates of {\tt t} will be irrational.

Now let {\tt p} and {\tt q} be points on an infinite line {\tt pq}
and let {\tt c} be a circle of radius {\tt r}.  Does {\tt pq} intersect
the circle, and is it tangent?

If {\tt pq} is tangent, the point {\tt t} where it intersects the
circle is also the point on the line closest to {\tt c}.  By
the argument on page \pageref{CLOSEST-IS-RATIONAL}, if
{\tt p}, {\tt q}, and {\tt c} all have rational coordinates, then
{\tt t} will have rational coordinates, but by the argument immediately
above, it will usually have irrational coordinates.  From this
we conclude that {\tt pq} is usually not tangent to the circle
if {\tt p}, {\tt q}, and {\tt c} all have rational coordinates and
{\tt r} is a rational number.

\end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{wrapfigure}
So let us just assume for the moment that the line intersects
the circle, and locate the points of intersection (see picture).
By section \ref{LINE-AND-POINT}, page \pageref{LINE-AND-POINT},
we can find the point {\tt t} on the line that is closest to
{\tt c}, and find the distance {\tt ||t-c||}.  Then the line {\tt tc} is
perpendicular to {\tt pq} as if it were not sliding {\tt t}
along the {\tt pq} line would reduce {\tt ||t-c||}.
If {\tt s} is an intersection point of {\tt pq} and the circle, we have: \\
\hspace*{0.2in}\begin{tabular}{@{}l}
    {\tt ||s-c||$^2$ = r$^2$ = ||t-c||$^2$ + ||t-s||$^2$} \\
    so {\tt ||t-s|| = $\sqrt{{\tt r}^2 - {\tt ||t-c||}^2}$} \\
    and if we define {\tt u = (q-p)!} we have \\
    {\tt s = t $\pm$ ||t-s||*u} \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{minipage}

The reason for the $\pm$ is that we actually have two possible
values for {\tt s}, one on either side of the line {\tt tc}.

The distance {\tt ||t-s||} goes to zero as {\tt ||t-c||} approaches
{\tt r}, and cannot be computed if {\tt ||t-c|| > r}, in which case
the line is completely outside the circle and does not intersect the
circle.

We end this section by examining the case of a \underline{finite}
line {\tt pq} and a circle with center {\tt c} and radius {\tt r}.
Find the point {\tt t} on the infinite line {\tt pq} closest to
{\tt c}, and the points {\tt s} that where the infinite line intersects
the circle, if they exist.
Then use the {\tt (q-p)*} product to establish coordinates on the
infinite line: \\
\centerline{\tt (q-p)*p ~~~ (q-p)*q ~~~ (q-p)*t ~~~ (q-p)*s} \\
By exchanging {\tt p} with {\tt q}
\underline{if necessary} we can arrange that \\
\centerline{\tt (q-p)*p < (q-p)*q} \\
so {\tt t} is in the finite line {\tt pq} if and only if
{\tt (q-p)*p $\leq$ (q-p)*t $\leq$ (q-p)*q}.
Similarly we can find out if an intersection point is on the finite
line.

So what points on the finite line {\tt pq} are closest to the circle?
If {\tt pq} intersects the circle these are the intersection points.
Otherwise there are two cases: {\tt pq} is outside the circle and
{\tt pq} is inside the circle.

To make further progress, we are \underline{not} going to use the fact that the
circle is a circle.
Instead we will use the fact that the circle viewed
as an area is a closed convex set, and the circle viewed as an arc
is the boundary of such a set.  This allows us to prove our results
for closed convex sets, and apply the results to circles, ellipses,
rectangles, and convex polygons.

\begin{definition}
The \key{boundary} of a set $S$ of the points in the plane
(i.e., $S\subset\mathcal{R}^2$) is the
set of points $p$ such that every sufficiently small circle with
center $p$ contains a point in $S$ and another point not in $S$.

A set $S$ of points in the plane is \key{closed} if every point
of the boundary of $S$ is in $S$.

A set $S$ of points in a plane is a \key{bounded set} if and only if
there is a circle that includes $S$.
\end{definition}

We need $S$ to be closed in order to use the notion of
closest point.

\begin{lemma}\label{MINIMUM-DISTANCE}
Let $S_1$ and $S_2$ be close sets one of which is bounded.
Then there are points
$p_1\in S_1$ and $p_2\in S_2$ such that $||p_1-p_2||$ is as
small as possible (i.e., for every $q_1\in S_1$ and $q_2\in S_2$,
$||q_1-q_2||\ge||p_1-p_2||$).
\end{lemma}

We will \underline{not} give the proof of this,
which involves the mathematics of compact
sets (i.e., uses the fact that a closed bounded set is compact).

Some easily proved facts about boundaries are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The boundary of a set $S$ is also the boundary of the
complement $\mathcal{R}^2-S$ of $S$.
\item The boundary $B$ of a closed set $S$ is itself closed
(i.e., $B$ is a closed set). \\
(In fact, the boundary of any set $S$ is closed, but this is
a bit harder to prove.)

\end{enumerate}

Another important fact about closed sets and their boundaries is:

\begin{lemma}\label{BOUNDARY-CROSSING}
If $S$ is a closed set, $p$ is a point in $S$, and $q$ is a point
outside of $S$, then the finite line $pq$ contains a point on the
boundary of $S$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{indpar}{0.2in}
Proof: Consider the points $r=p+\alpha*(q-p)$ for $0\le\alpha\le 1$,
that is, the points $r$ on the finite line $pq$.
All circles with center $p$ contain a point of $S$ as $p$ is in $S$.
All sufficiently small circles with center $q$ contain only points
outside of $S$, as $q$ is outside of $S$ and not on the boundary of $S$
(which is a subset of $S$).  Let $\alpha'$ be the smallest number such
that $r=p+\alpha*(q-p)$ is outside $S$ for all $\alpha>\alpha'$ and
let $r_0=p+\alpha'*(q-p)$.  Then $r_0$ is in $S$, for if it were not,
a sufficiently small circle with center $r_0$ would be completely
outside $S$, and $\alpha'$ would be smaller than it is.  But every
circle with center $r_0$ includes a point $r=p+\alpha*(q-p)$,
$\alpha>\alpha'$ which
is outside of $S$.  So $r_0$ is on the boundary of $S$.
\end{indpar}

\begin{definition}
A set $S$ of the points in a plane
is a \key{convex set} if and only if for any two points $p$ and $q$ in $S$
and any scalar $0\le\alpha\le 1$,
$\alpha*p+(1-\alpha)*q \in S$
(i.e., the finite line segment $pq$ is in $S$).
\end{definition}

In order to deal with the case where the finite line $pq$ is outside
the circle, we will prove:

\begin{theorem}\label{POINT-OUTSIDE-THEOREM}
The distance from a finite line $pq$ to a closed convex set $S$ when
$pq$ is \underline{outside} of $S$ is one of:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The distance from the infinite line $pq$ to $S$ if
a point on the infinite line closest to $S$ is in the finite line $pq$.
\item The distance from $p$ to $S$.
\item The distance from $q$ to $S$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

Given this and a finite line {\tt pq} \underline{outside} the
circle,
we compute the point {\tt t} on the infinite line {\tt pq} that is
closest to the center of the circle
and check if that is in the finite line {\tt pq}.  If not, then the
closest point is either {\tt p} or {\tt q}, by the Theorem.

To prove the theorem we need a definition and some lemmas.

\begin{definition}
A function $F$ on a convex set of points $S$ is a \key{convex function}
if and only if
for any two points $p$ and $q$ in $S$ and
$0\le\alpha\le 1$,
$D(\alpha*p+(1-\alpha)*q)\le\alpha*F(p) + (1-\alpha)*F(q)$.
\end{definition}

Next note that for any two vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$,
\begin{center}
$|v_1*v_2|\le||v_1||*||v_2||$ \\
because $v_1*v_2 = ||v_1||*||v_2||*\cos\theta$ and $|\cos\theta|\le 1$ \\
where $\theta = \mathrm{asm}~v_2 - \mathrm{asm}~v_1$
\end{center}

Using this we prove:

\begin{lemma}
Let $S$ be a closed convex set and $pq$ be an infinite line.  For $r$ on $pq$,
define $D(r)$ to be the distance from $r$ to $S$ (distance of
$r$ to a point in $S$ closest to $r$).  Then $D(r)$ is a convex
function on the infinite line.
\end{lemma}
\begin{indpar}{0.2in}
Proof: \\
~\begin{tabular}[t]{l}
let $s_i$ be a point in $S$ closest to $r_i$ \\
let $r=\alpha*r_1+(1-\alpha)*r_2$
and $s=\alpha*s_1+(1-\alpha)*s_2$ \\
let $v_i=r_i-s_i$ and $v=r-s$ so $D(r_i)=||v_i||$ and $D(r)\le||v||$ \\
then \\
~$D(r)^2$\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l}
    $\le v*v = (\alpha*v_1+(1-\alpha)*v_2)*(\alpha*v_1+(1-\alpha)*v_2)$ \\
    $= \alpha^2 v_1*v_1 + 2*\alpha*(1-\alpha)*v_1*v_2 + (1-\alpha)^2*v_2*v_2$ \\
    $\le \alpha^2*||v_1||^2 + 2*\alpha*(1-\alpha)*||v_1||*||v_2||
                           + (1-\alpha)^2*||v_2||^2$ \\
    $= (\alpha*||v_1|| + (1-\alpha)*||v_2||)^2$ \\
    $= (\alpha*D(r_1) + (1-\alpha)*D(r_2))^2$ \\
    \end{tabular} \\
so $D(r)\le\alpha*D(r_1)+(1-\alpha)*D(r_2)$
\end{tabular}
\end{indpar}

Note that if $r$ is in $S$, $D(r) = 0$.

\begin{lemma}
Let $F$ be a convex function on an infinite line,
let $p$ and $q$ be points on the line, and set $r=p+\alpha*(q-p)$
for some scalar $\alpha\ge 1$.  Then $F(r)\ge(1-\alpha)*F(p)+\alpha*F(q)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{indpar}{0.2in}
Proof: $r-p = \alpha*(q-p)$ so $q-p=(1/\alpha)*(r-p)$ and as $F$ is convex,
$F(q)\le(1-1/\alpha)*F(p)+(1/\alpha)*F(r)$ from which the result
follows.
\end{indpar}

\begin{corollary}\label{CONVEX-EXTENSION}
If $F(q)> F(p)$ and $\alpha>1$ then $F(r)> F(p)$.
\end{corollary}

Now we can prove our theorem:

\begin{indpar}{0.2in}
Proof of Theorem \ref{POINT-OUTSIDE-THEOREM}:
By Lemma~\ref{MINIMUM-DISTANCE} there are points $r$ on the
finite line $pq$ that are closest to $S$.  If either $p$ or $q$ is
one of these points, we are done.  Otherwise
let $r_0$ be a point on the finite line $pq$ closest to $S$.
If $D(r)$ is the distance from $r$ to $S$ for $r$ on the infinite line $pq$,
we have $D(p)>D(r_0)<D(q)$ so from Corollary~\ref{CONVEX-EXTENSION}
$D(r)>D(r_0)$ for all $r$ on the infinite line $pq$ but outside the
finite line $pq$.  Therefore $r_0$ is a closest point to $S$ on the
infinite line $pq$.
\end{indpar}


So next we turn to the case where {\tt pq} is \underline{inside} the
circle.

\begin{theorem}\label{POINT-INSIDE-THEOREM}
The distance from a finite line $pq$ to the boundary of a
closed convex set $S$ when
$pq$ is \underline{inside} of $S$ is one of:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The distance from $p$ to the boundary of $S$.
\item The distance from $q$ to the boundary of $S$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

The application of this theorem is obvious.

To prove the theorem we need one definition and some lemmas.

\begin{definition}
For a set $S$ of points, the \key{convex hull} of $S$ is the
smallest convex set containing $S$.
\end{definition}

The convex hull is clearly the union of all finite lines {\tt pq} for
all pairs of points {\tt p} and {\tt q} in $S$.  The convex hull of
a convex set $S$ is clearly $S$ itself.
If $T$ is a subset of a convex set $S$,
the convex hull of $T$ is clearly a subset of $S$.



TBD


The points on the infinite line can be represented as
{\tt p+h*(q-p)} for scalars {\tt h}, and the square of the distance of such a
point from {\tt c} is then \\
\centerline{\tt (p+h*(q-p))*(p+h*(q-p))} \\
which is a quadratic
function of {\tt h}.  It has a minimum at {\tt p+h*(q-p) == t} and
is increasing as the point moves away from {\tt t}.

Therefore, if {\tt t} is on the finite line {\tt pq} it is the point on
that line closest to {\tt c}, and if {\tt t} is not on the line, either
{\tt p} or {\tt q} is the point closest to {\tt c}.  In either case
either {\tt p} or {\tt q} is the point farthest from {\tt c}.  Using
this information you can establish the minimum distance of the finite
line {\tt pq} from the circle viewed as a curved line (and \underline{not}
as an area).  You do not need to calculate intersection points {\tt s}
to determine whether there is an intersection.

\section{Ellipse, Line, and Point}
In this section we investigate the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item How do you define an ellipse?
\item Where do the lines tangent to an ellipse that pass through
an external point contact the ellipse?
\item What is the distance between a point and an ellipse (viewed as
a curving line and \underline{not} an area)?
Is the point on the ellipse?
\item Does an infinite line intersect an ellipse?  Is it
tangent to the ellipse?  Where does it intersect?
\item What is the distance between a finite line segment and
a circle?  If zero, where are the intersections?  If not zero,
where is the point on the finite line segment that is closest to the
ellipse.
\end{enumerate}

A circle with center at {\tt (0,0)} and radius {\tt r} is the set:
\begin{center}
$\{ (x,y) : (\frac{x}{r})^2 + (\frac{y}{r})^2 = 1 \}
=
\{ (r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta): 0\leq\theta< 2\pi \}$
\end{center}

An \key{ellipse} with center at {\tt (0,0)}, \key{major axis} {\tt M}
and \key{minor axis} {\tt m}, with the major axis in the X-axis direction
(the minor axis is always perpendicular to the major axis) is the set:
\begin{center}
$\{ (x,y) : (\frac{x}{M})^2 + (\frac{y}{m})^2 = 1 \}
=
\{ (M\cos\theta,m\sin\theta): 0\leq\theta< 2\pi \}$
\end{center}

Lets call a circle with center {\tt (0,0)} a \key{reference circle}.
Then an arbitrary circle is made by translating the reference circle
so its center is moved to an arbitrary point. \\

Lets call an ellipse with center {\tt (0,0)} and major axis aligned with
the X-axis a \key{reference ellipse}.
Then an arbitrary ellipse is made by first rotating the reference ellipse
to align its major axis in an arbitrary direction, and then
translating it so its center is moved to an arbitrary point. \\
~ \\
Conversly, if you have an arbitrary ellipse, a translation followed
by a rotation will turn it into a reference ellipse.  So we are only
going to consider reference ellipses in this section.

\medskip

The reference circle with unit radius is closely related to
the reference ellipse by the linear transformation: \\
\centerline{$L = (M*u_x,m*u_y): (x,y) \longmapsto (M*x,m*y)$} \\
This is because: \\
\centerline{$L*(\cos\theta,\sin\theta) = (M*\cos\theta,m*\sin\theta)$}

More explicitly, let $S$ be any set of points in ${\mathcal R}^2$
and define $L * S = \{ L*p: p \in S \}$.
Let $C$ be the reference circle of radius 1, which we will
call the \key{reference unit circle}, and let $E$ be the reference
ellipse with major axis $M$ and minor axis $m$.

Then $L*C = E$.

This is important because of the following.

First, note that $L^{-1}$, the inverse of $L$, exists (where we assume
$M,m>0$) and is such that \\
\centerline{$L^{-1} = (M^{-1}*u_x,m^{-1}*u_y): (x,y)
            \longmapsto (M^{-1}*x,m^{-1}*y)$} \\
\centerline{$L^{-1}*(M*\cos\theta,m*\sin\theta) = (\cos\theta,\sin\theta)$} \\
so $L^{-1}*E=C$.

Then
\begin{itemize}
\item If $S$ is a straight line tangent to $C$, then $L*S$ is a straight
line tangent to $E$.
\item If $S$ is a straight line tangent to $E$, then $L^{-1}*S$ is a straight
line tangent to $C$.
\end{itemize}

In general, for any linear transformation $\mathcal{L}$ and straight line
$S$, $\mathcal{L}*S$ is a straight line.  This is because for some point
$p$ and vector $v$, \\
\hspace*{0.5in}\begin{tabular}{ll}
$S$ & $= \{ p+s*v : s~\mathrm{is~a~scalar}\}$ \\
$\mathcal{L}*S$
    & $= \{ \mathcal{L}*(p+s*v) : s~\mathrm{is~a~scalar}\}$ \\
    & $= \{ \mathcal{L}*p+s*(\mathcal{L}*v) : s~\mathrm{is~a~scalar}\}$ \\
\end{tabular} \\
That is, linear transformations `preserve' straight lines.

Also, if $\mathcal{L}$ is a 1-1 map (as both $L$ and $L^{-1}$ are),
and if $S_1$ and $S_2$ are two sets of points, then
$\mathcal{L}*(S_1\cap S_2) = (\mathcal{L}*S_1)\cap(\mathcal{L}*S_2)$.
That is, intersections are `preserved'.  A straight line is tangent
to an ellipse or circle if and only if the two intersect in a single
point, and as intersections and straight lines are preserved, tangency
is preserved by $L$ and $L^{-1}$.

Now consider the problem of finding the point $t$ on the reference ellipse
where a straight line passing through a point $p$ external to the
ellipse and tangent to the ellipse touches the ellipse.  Then
$T=L^{-1}*t$ is the point on $C$ where a straight line passing through
the point $P=L^{-1}*p$ and tangent to $C$ touches $C$.  Using the
methods of page~\pageref{FINDING-TANGENT-POINT} we can find $T$ and
therefore $t=L*T$.

Now consider the problem of finding the point $q$ on the reference ellipse
that is closest to $p$.  Let $t_1$ and $t_2$ be the two points on the
reference ellipse where straight lines passing through $p$ and tangent
to the ellipse touch the ellipse.  Let $P=L^{-1}*p$, $Q=L^{-1}*1$,
$T_1=L^{-1}*t_1$, $T_2=L^{-1}*t_2$.
Let $\theta=\mathrm{asm}~Q$,
$\theta_1=\mathrm{asm}~T_1$,
$\theta_2=\mathrm{asm}~T_2$.
We know $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ and want to find $\theta$.
See picture.

The key fact is that the tangent to the ellipse at $q$ must be perpendicular
to the line $pq$.  If it were not, sliding $q$ along the ellipse in one
direction would decrease $||q-p||$.  Let the direction of the line tangent
to the ellipse at \\
\centerline{$q_\phi = (M*\cos\phi,m*\sin\phi)$} \\
be given by a vector $v_\phi$.
Then the function $F(\phi)=(q_\phi-p)!*v_\phi!$ is $0$ at $\phi=\theta$
and monotonic between $\phi=\theta_1$ and $\phi=\theta_2$.  If we can compute
$F(\phi)$ from $\phi$, we can use binary search to compute $\theta$.

As $q_\phi = (M*\cos\phi,m*\sin\phi)$ the problem reduces to computing $v_\phi$.
Let $Q_\phi = L^{-1}*q_\phi = (\cos\phi,\sin\phi)$ and
$V_\phi=L^{-1}*v_\phi$.  Then this last is the direction of the tangent
to $C$ at $Q_\phi$, and we can take this direction as
$R^{90}*Q=(-\sin\phi,\cos\phi)$ so we can take
$V_\phi=(-\sin\phi,\cos\phi)$ and therefore $v_\phi=(-M*\sin\phi,m*\cos\phi)$.
Now doing the binary search finds $\theta$.
